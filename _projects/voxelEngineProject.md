summary: "Basic game engine with a gameobject system and a hybrid renderer of rasterized 3D meshes and raytraced objects (e.g. voxels)."
shortDescription: "This is a template with example data that shows how an example project should look. This short description could extend a paragraph or two, but not get too much into detail."
longDescription: "This is my very long description, it could go on, and on, and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on, but it wont. It can also include html tags like <strong>this one</strong>..."
