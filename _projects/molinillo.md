shortDescription: "This is an action-adventure 3D sidescroller game currently being developed by a team of 3 people. This game was born as a small tribute to the famous spanish streamers <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/borjapavon'>Borja Pavón</a> and <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/thecatacroquer'>TheCatacroquer</a> and their GTA V roleplay characters, but the project grew quite large. Now we count with their collaboration and support of their communities."
