summary: "Simulator that tests the prey-predator model with bushes and trees, and trains a genetic algorithm to fine tune the parameters"
shortDescription: "<p>This project was my computer science's bachelor's thesis. I worked on it for over a year, and it encompased working on an offline simulator, implementing rules for evolution such as genomes, mutation, gene crossover; working on all the UI and data serialization; doing quite a lot of data analysis tools; and implementing a genetic algorithm that runs the simulator dozens of times to fine-tune the parameters and find stability between both types of entities: bushes and trees. </p>"

                  This is my very long description, it could go on, and on, and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on, but it wont. It can also include html tags like <strong>this one</strong>...

                    Everything was designed and implemented by me. The most relevant systems that I worked on include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Spatio-temporal clustering algorithm
                </p>
                <p>
                    - GPU compute shaders to detect collisions and calculate interactions between entities
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Genetic Algorithm that runs dozens of simulations to fine-tune the simulator itself
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Data analysis tools like heatmaps, plots, entity attributes...
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Revisit past simulations at any saved point, and visit the live scene at that time
                </p>
