summary: "Venture into the depths of the sea to collect ancient artefacts for your company while piloting an old rusty submarine. Avoid looming creatures..."
shortDescription: "This is a first-person game set in the depths of the ocean where you control an unreliable and rusty submarine. Your goal is to collect some lost ancient artefacts while trying to maneuver through an underwater ravine with indirect controls, and fixing any malfunction that might show up during your voyage. You also have to be cautious with the <i>creatures of the deep</i>. Use the different books that you have available to learn about those two things. <br>
 This was a project course made in the span of 7 weeks with the topic 'Public Domain', which whe implemented through real life scans of ancient sculptures."
longDescription: "This is my very long description, it could go on, and on, and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on,and on, but it wont. It can also include html tags like <strong>this one</strong>..."

                    In this game I wanted to focus on learning how to use Blender, and I worked on most of the 3D assets outside the submarine. However, I also implemented some other technical bits:

                  <li>PID Controller for the physics of the submarine and controls</li>
                  <li>All the interaction system with the bookshelf, including the procedural animation of the robot arm</li>
                  <li>Fully implemented the 3D model and texture, AI, and procedural animations of a creature of the depths</li>
                  <li>Composed the main theme that plays in the start menu</li>
                  <li>Helping coleagues integrate their systems in a structured way</li>
                  <li>Pushing forward with bugfixing on the last stretch of the project</li>
